  Based on the official Umbrel's Pi-hole App.


  This is a replacement for the Pi-Hole app provided by the official Umbrel App Store (as it uses the same ports).


  This version of Pi-Hole comes with DNSCrypt installed and configured to encrypt your DNS queries from peeping eyes.


  Pi-Hole runs DNS queries through DNSCrypt, which resolves DNS queries using HTTPS (secure connections) instead of
  unencrypted DNS queries. This ensures that your DNS queries are encrypted and secure.
