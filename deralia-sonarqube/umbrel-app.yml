  SonarQube is an on-premise analysis tool designed to detect quality and security issues in 30+ languages, frameworks,
  and IaC platforms. The solution also provides fix recommendations leveraging AI with Sonar's AI CodeFix capability.


  By integrating directly with your CI pipeline or on one of the supported DevOps platforms, your code is checked
  against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and
  security issues on each merge/pull request.
